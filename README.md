# Glossary

A glossary of terms used by Agile Sprints.

## KPI

Key Performance Indicators.
Agile KPIs provide guidance for strategic planning, evaluation, and improving operational processes.
Traditional value management systems tend to focus on task completion within the framework of categorical schedule and cost

## OKR

Objectives and Key Results.
OKR: an Agile Goal Setting Framework.
OKR is a goal setting framework created by Intel and adopted by several Silicon Valley companies.
So an OKR can be thought of a commitment stated as: I will (Objective) as measured by (this set of Key Results).

## Agile methodology

AGILE methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project.
In the Agile model, both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model.

## SCRUM methodology

Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development.
Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product.

## Sprint

Using Agile project management methodologies, projects are broken down into sprints or iterations.
These are short, repeatable phases, typically one to four weeks in length.
Each sprint should result in a draft, prototype or workable version of the final project deliverable.

## Velocity

Velocity is the master KPI you should look at.
It is a measure of the amount of work your team can tackle during a single sprint and is the key metric in Scrum.
How fast are we going is the question. It is a compound indicator of 5 different variables that are
(n) number of commits,
(e) edition,
(t) number of merged tickets,
(p) merged tickets average lead time,
(r) average time to review.
The computation is: velocity = n * e * t / (1000 * p * r).

Augmenting the teams' velocity should be your goal as a manager.
To do so, you have to identify the pain points in your organization such as stale tickets and lack of reviews.

In the future we will offer tooling and learning to augment your velocity.

## Feature

In agile development, a feature is a chunk of functionality that delivers business value.
Features can include additions or changes to existing functionality.
For planning purposes, some agile methodologies also use the notion of "work items" that can include features, bug fixes, documents, and other artifacts

## LOCs

Using Lines Of Code (LOCs) as a metric is meaningful on large scales only. So using it project-wise makes sense. Comparing LOCs produced per developer is pointless since their work may differ qualitatively. But comparing the evolution of LOCs sprints-wise gives a macrocopic view of your progress.

Remember to exclude large autogenerated files from the analysis by setting the exclusion patterns in our app.

## Commit

The "commit" is used to save the changes to the local repository.
Note that one have to explicitly tell Git which changes he want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command.
This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.

## Pull Request

Pull requests let one tell others about changes one have pushed to a GitHub repository.
Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

## Review

Submitting your review:
1. On the pull request, click Files changed.
2. Above the changed code, click Review changes.
3.Type a comment summarizing your feedback on the proposed changes.
4. Select the type of review you'd like to leave
5. Click Submit review.
